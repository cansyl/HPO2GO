**ABSTRACT**

Analysing the relations between the genetic diseases and biomolecules is a highly active area of research, where the aim is to identify the genes and gene products that cause a particular disease due to functional changes originated from mutations. Biological ontologies are frequently employed for this purpose, which provided researchers with extensive opportunities for knowledge discovery through computational data analysis.

In this study, a novel approach is proposed for the identification of relations between biomedical entities by automatically mapping phenotypic abnormality defining HPO terms with biomolecular function defining GO terms, where each association indicates the occurrence of the abnormality due to the loss of the biomolecular function expressed by the corresponding GO term. The proposed HPO2GO mappings were extracted by calculating the frequency of the co-annotations of the terms on the same genes/proteins, using already existing curated HPO and GO annotation sets. This was followed by the filtering of the unreliable mappings that could be observed due to chance, by statistical resampling of the co-occurrence similarity distributions. Furthermore, the biological relevance of the finalized mappings were discussed over selected cases, using the literature.

The resulting HPO2GO mappings can be employed in different settings to predict and to analyse novel gene/protein - ontology term - disease relations. As an application of the proposed approach, HPO term - protein associations (i.e., HPO2protein) are predicted. In order to test the predictive performance of the method on a quantitative basis, and to compare it with the state-of-the-art, CAFA2 challenge HPO prediction target protein set was employed. The results of the benchmark indicated the potential of the proposed approach, as HPO2GO beat all models from 38 participating groups (Fmax=0.402), by a margin of 12.6% from the top performer. It is important to note that, HPO2GO was not proposed to replace, but to complement the conventional approaches used in the field of biomedical relation discovery. The automated cross ontology mapping approach developed in this work can easily be extended to other ontologies as well, to identify unexplored relation patterns at the systemic level. The proposed approach will be more effective when combined with powerful techniques such as text/literature mining.
