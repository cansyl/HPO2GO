Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry. Most of the mutations alter the nucleus-cytoplasm distribution of AIRE and disturb its association with nuclear dots and cytoplasmic filaments. Most of the mutations also decrease transactivation of the protein. The HSR domain is responsible for the homomultimerization activity of AIRE. All the missense mutations of the HSR and the SAND domains decrease this activity, but those in other domains do not. The AIRE protein is present in soluble high-molecular-weight complexes. Mutations in the HSR domain and deletion of PHD zinc fingers disturb the formation of these complexes (PubMed:14974083). Heterozigous mutations within the PHD1 domain have dominant-negatif effects and cause organ-specific autoimmune diseases (PubMed:26084028). Patients harbor extremely high-affinity, neutralizing autoantibodies, particularly against specific cytokines such as type I interferons which could protect them from some types of autoimmune diseases, like type I diabetes (PubMed:27426947). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974083, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26084028, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27426947}.	3453;

P23352	ANOS1	DISEASE: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 1 with or without anosmia (HH1) [MIM:308700]: A disorder characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation by the age of 18 years, in conjunction with low levels of circulating gonadotropins and testosterone and no other abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11297579, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15001591, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15605412, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17054399, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17213338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17223984, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20530987, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21168128, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23643382, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25077900, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8504298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8989261, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9589672}.

Individuals carrying the common APOE*4 variant are at higher risk of CAD.; DISEASE: Alzheimer disease 2 (AD2) [MIM:104310]: A late-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia, loss of cognitive abilities, and deposition of fibrillar amyloid proteins as intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, extracellular amyloid plaques and vascular amyloid deposits. The major constituent of these plaques is the neurotoxic amyloid-beta-APP 40-42 peptide (s), derived proteolytically from the transmembrane precursor protein APP by sequential secretase processing. The cytotoxic C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and the caspase-cleaved products such as C31 derived from APP, are also implicated in neuronal death. Note=Disease susceptibility is associated with variations affecting the gene represented in this entry. The APOE*4 allele is genetically associated with the common late onset familial and sporadic forms of Alzheimer disease. Risk for AD increased from 20% to 90% and mean age at onset decreased from 84 to 68 years with increasing number of APOE*4 alleles in 42 families with late onset AD. Thus APOE*4 gene dose is a major risk factor for late onset AD and, in these families, homozygosity for APOE*4 was virtually sufficient to cause AD by age 80.

P05067	APP	DISEASE: Alzheimer disease 1 (AD1) [MIM:104300]: A familial early-onset form of Alzheimer disease. It can be associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia, loss of cognitive abilities, and deposition of fibrillar amyloid proteins as intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, extracellular amyloid plaques and vascular amyloid deposits. The major constituent of these plaques is the neurotoxic amyloid-beta-APP 40-42 peptide (s), derived proteolytically from the transmembrane precursor protein APP by sequential secretase processing. The cytotoxic C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and the caspase-cleaved products such as C31 derived from APP, are also implicated in neuronal death. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10097173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10631141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10665499, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10867787, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11063718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11528419, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12034808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1302033, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1303239, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1303275, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1415269, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15201367, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365148, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15668448, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1671712, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1678058, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1908231, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1925564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1944558, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8267572, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8290042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8476439, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8577393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9328472, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9754958}.

Note=Disease susceptibility is associated with variations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 5 with or without anosmia (HH5) [MIM:612370]: A disorder characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation by the age of 18 years, in conjunction with low levels of circulating gonadotropins and testosterone and no other abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18834967, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21158681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25077900}.

P82279	CRB1	DISEASE: Note=CRB1 mutations have been found in various retinal dystrophies, chronic and disabling disorders of visual function. They predominantly involve the posterior portion of the ocular fundus, due to degeneration in the sensory layer of the retina, retinal pigment epithelium, Bruch membrane, choroid, or a combination of these tissues. Onset of inherited retinal dystrophies is painless, bilateral and typically progressive. Most people experience gradual peripheral vision loss or tunnel vision, and difficulties with poor illumination and night vision. Central vision is usually unaffected, so the person may still be able to read. However, it can also deteriorate to cause total blindness. Examples of retinal dystrophies are retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis, cone-rod dystrophy among others. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20683928, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22065545}.; DISEASE: Retinitis pigmentosa 12 (RP12) [MIM:600105]: A retinal dystrophy belonging to the group of pigmentary retinopathies.

Opacities vary in morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be static or progressive. CTRCT3 includes congenital cerulean and sutural cataract with punctate and cerulean opacities, among others. Cerulean cataract is characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract. Sutural cataract with punctate and cerulean opacities is characterized by white opacification around the anterior and posterior Y sutures, and grayish and bluish, spindle shaped, oval punctate and cerulean opacities of various sizes arranged in lamellar form. The spots are more concentrated towards the peripheral layers and do not delineate the embryonal or fetal nucleus. Phenotypic variation with respect to the size and density of the sutural opacities as well as the number and position of punctate and cerulean spots is observed among affected subjects. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10634616, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9158139}.

In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23643382}.

The onset of symptoms usually occurs in the first or second decade of life. Affected individuals usually present with impairment of upper extremity elevation. This tends to be followed by facial weakness, primarily involving the orbicularis oris and orbicularis oculi muscles. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10433963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19320656}. Note=The gene represented in this entry is involved in disease pathogenesis. The disease is caused by deletion of an integral number of units of a 3.3-kb tandem repeats, termed D4Z4 macrosatellite, located on chromosome 4q35. In unaffected subjects, the D4Z4 array consists of 11-150 repeats, while in FSHD1 patients, the array is reduced to 1-10 repeats (PubMed:19320656). DUX4 is located in D4Z4 macrosatellite which is epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues. D4Z4 chromatin relaxation in FSHD1 results in inefficient epigenetic repression of DUX4 and a variegated pattern of DUX4 protein expression in a subset of skeletal muscle nuclei. Ectopic expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle activates the expression of stem cell and germline genes, and, when overexpressed in somatic cells, DUX4 can ultimately lead to cell death. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19320656}.	269;

It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19098912}.

Q9NZU0	FLRT3	DISEASE: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 21 with or without anosmia (HH21) [MIM:615271]: A disorder characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation by the age of 18 years, in conjunction with low levels of circulating gonadotropins and testosterone and no other abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23643382}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting distinct genetic loci, including the gene represented in this entry. Some patients carrying mutations in FLRT3 also have a mutation in another HH-associated gene including FGFR1, HS6ST1 and FGF17 (PubMed:23643382). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23643382}.	478;

P36888	FLT3	DISEASE: Leukemia, acute myelogenous (AML) [MIM:601626]: A subtype of acute leukemia, a cancer of the white blood cells. AML is a malignant disease of bone marrow characterized by maturational arrest of hematopoietic precursors at an early stage of development. Clonal expansion of myeloid blasts occurs in bone marrow, blood, and other tissue. Myelogenous leukemias develop from changes in cells that normally produce neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils and monocytes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11090077, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11290608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11442493, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14504097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16266983, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18305215, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8946930, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9737679}. Note=The gene represented in this entry may be involved in disease pathogenesis. Somatic mutations that lead to constitutive activation of FLT3 are frequent in AML patients. These mutations fall into two classes, the most common being in-frame internal tandem duplications of variable length in the juxtamembrane region that disrupt the normal regulation of the kinase activity. Likewise, point mutations in the activation loop of the kinase domain can result in a constitutively activated kinase.	98829;102724;98837;98834;98833;98832;99860;99861;

The onset of symptoms usually occurs in the first or second decade of life. Affected individuals usually present with impairment of upper extremity elevation. This tends to be followed by facial weakness, primarily involving the orbicularis oris and orbicularis oculi muscles. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16341202, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23720823}. Note=The gene represented in this entry may be involved in disease pathogenesis. Overexpression of human FRG1 in mice leads to development of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD1)-like symptoms such as kyphosis, progressive muscle dystrophy and skeletal muscle atrophy (PubMed:16341202). It also causes aberrant pre-mRNA splicing of TNNT3 and MTMR1, affects the localization and activity of KMT5B, and leads to increased levels of EID3, resulting in inhibited muscle differentiation (PubMed:23720823). These results suggest that FSHD1 results from inappropriate overexpression of FRG1 which leads to abnormal alternative splicing of specific pre-mRNAs. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16341202, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23720823}.	269;

First, in areas in which malaria has been endemic, G6PD-deficiency alleles have reached high frequencies (1% to 50%) and deficient individuals, though essentially asymptomatic in the steady state, have a high risk of acute hemolytic attacks. Secondly, sporadic cases of G6PD deficiency occur at a very low frequencies, and they usually present a more severe phenotype. Several types of NSHA are recognized. Class-I variants are associated with severe NSHA; class-II have an activity <10% of normal; class-III have an activity of 10% to 60% of normal; class-IV have near normal activity.	362;
P10253	GAA	DISEASE: Glycogen storage disease 2 (GSD2) [MIM:232300]: A metabolic disorder with a broad clinical spectrum. The severe infantile form, or Pompe disease, presents at birth with massive accumulation of glycogen in muscle, heart and liver. Cardiomyopathy and muscular hypotonia are the cardinal features of this form whose life expectancy is less than two years. The juvenile and adult forms present as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy beginning in the lower limbs. Final outcome depends on respiratory muscle failure. Patients with the adult form can be free of clinical symptoms for most of their life but finally develop a slowly progressive myopathy. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10189220, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10206684, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10338092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10737124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11071489, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11738358, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12601120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12923862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14643388, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14695532, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14972326, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15145338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15668445, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16433701, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1652892, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16782080, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1684505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16917947, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17643989, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18425781, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18429042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1898413, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19588081, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20080426, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20350966, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21109266, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22644586, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22676651, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25681614, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7695647, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7717400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7866409, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7881422, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7981676, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8094613, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8401535, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8834250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9521422, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9535769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9660056, ECO:0000269|Ref.5}.

P30968	GNRHR	DISEASE: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 7 with or without anosmia (HH7) [MIM:146110]: A disorder characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation by the age of 18 years, in conjunction with low levels of circulating gonadotropins and testosterone and no other abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10022417, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10084584, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10523035, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11318785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11397842, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11397871, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12679486, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23643382, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25077900, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9371856, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9425890}.

Thalassemias are common monogenic diseases occurring mostly in Mediterranean and Southeast Asian populations. The hallmark of beta-thalassemia is an imbalance in globin-chain production in the adult HbA molecule. Absence of beta chain causes beta(0)-thalassemia, while reduced amounts of detectable beta globin causes beta(+)-thalassemia. In the severe forms of beta-thalassemia, the excess alpha globin chains accumulate in the developing erythroid precursors in the marrow. Their deposition leads to a vast increase in erythroid apoptosis that in turn causes ineffective erythropoiesis and severe microcytic hypochromic anemia. Clinically, beta-thalassemia is divided into thalassemia major which is transfusion dependent, thalassemia intermedia (of intermediate severity), and thalassemia minor that is asymptomatic. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15481886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2399911, ECO:0000269|PubMed:6166632, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7693620}.

P03989	HLA-B	DISEASE: Spondyloarthropathy 1 (SPDA1) [MIM:106300]: A chronic rheumatic disease with multifactorial inheritance. It includes a spectrum of related disorders comprising ankylosing spondylitis, a subset of psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis (e.g. Reiter syndrome), arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy. These disorders may occur simultaneously or sequentially in the same patient, probably representing various phenotypic expressions of the same disease. Ankylosing spondylitis is the form of rheumatoid arthritis affecting the spine and is considered the prototype of seronegative spondyloarthropathies. It produces pain and stiffness as a result of inflammation of the sacroiliac, intervertebral, and costovertebral joints. Note=Disease susceptibility is associated with variations affecting the gene represented in this entry. A restricted number of HLA-B27 subtypes can be associated with ankylosing spondylitis and other B27-related diseases, and an elevated frequency of the B*2702 allele in ankylosing spondylitis patients is identified. The allele B*2707 seems to have a protective role some populations because it was found only in the healthy controls.

In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21700882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25077900}.

Q8NFM7	IL17RD	DISEASE: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 18 with or without anosmia (HH18) [MIM:615267]: A disorder characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation by the age of 18 years, in conjunction with low levels of circulating gonadotropins and testosterone and no other abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23643382}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting distinct genetic loci, including the gene represented in this entry.

Q8NI17	IL31RA	DISEASE: Amyloidosis, primary localized cutaneous, 2 (PLCA2) [MIM:613955]: A primary amyloidosis characterized by localized cutaneous amyloid deposition. This condition usually presents with itching (especially on the lower legs) and visible changes of skin hyperpigmentation and thickening that may be exacerbated by chronic scratching and rubbing. Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis is often divided into macular and lichen subtypes although many affected individuals often show both variants coexisting. Lichen amyloidosis characteristically presents as a pruritic eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules with a predilection for the shins, calves, ankles and dorsa of feet and thighs. Papules may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic plaques that can resemble lichen planus, lichen simplex or nodular prurigo. Macular amyloidosis is characterized by small pigmented macules that may merge to produce macular hyperpigmentation, sometimes with a reticulate or rippled pattern. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, amyloid is deposited in the papillary dermis in association with grouped colloid bodies, thought to represent degenerate basal keratinocytes. The amyloid deposits probably reflect a combination of degenerate keratin filaments, serum amyloid P component, and deposition of immunoglobulins. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19690585}.

Patients present in infancy recurrent, persistent infections by opportunistic organisms. The common characteristic of all types of SCID is absence of T-cell-mediated cellular immunity due to a defect in T-cell development. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Multiple sclerosis 3 (MS3) [MIM:612595]: A multifactorial, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Sclerotic lesions are characterized by perivascular infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes and appear as indurated areas in pathologic specimens (sclerosis in plaques). The pathological mechanism is regarded as an autoimmune attack of the myelin sheath, mediated by both cellular and humoral immunity. Clinical manifestations include visual loss, extra-ocular movement disorders, paresthesias, loss of sensation, weakness, dysarthria, spasticity, ataxia and bladder dysfunction. Genetic and environmental factors influence susceptibility to the disease. Note=Disease susceptibility is associated with variations affecting the gene represented in this entry. A polymorphism at position 244 strongly influences susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Overtransmission of the major 'C' allele coding for Thr-244 is detected in offspring affected with multiple sclerosis. In vitro analysis of transcripts from minigenes containing either 'C' allele (Thr-244) or 'T' allele (Ile-244) shows that the 'C' allele results in an approximately two-fold increase in the skipping of exon 6, leading to increased production of a soluble form of IL7R. Thus, the multiple sclerosis associated 'C' risk allele of IL7R would probably decrease membrane-bound expression of IL7R. As this risk allele is common in the general population, some additional triggers are probably required for the development and progression of MS.	39041;169154;

Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Note=Somatic mutations in KCNJ5 have been found in aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas and can be responsible for aldosteronism associated with cell autonomous proliferation. APAs are typically solitary, well circumscribed tumors diagnosed between ages 30 and 70. They come to medical attention due to new or worsening hypertension, often with hypokalemia. The precise role of KCNJ5 mutations in APA is under debate. They produce increased sodium conductance and cell depolarization, which in adrenal glomerulosa cells produces calcium entry, the signal for aldosterone production and cell proliferation. However, they may not be causative of APA development but may be a consequence of tumorigenesis, playing only a contributory role toward aldosterone overproduction and tumor growth (PubMed:22275527). Somatic mutations in KCNJ5 have not been found in non-aldosterone secreting adrenal adenomas suggesting that they are specifically associated with APA (PubMed:22275527 and PubMed:22848660). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21311022, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22203740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22275527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22848660}.	85142;37553;251274;101016;

Q15842	KCNJ8	DISEASE: Note=Defects in KCNJ8 may be associated with susceptibility to J-wave syndromes, a group of heart disorders characterized by early repolarization events as indicated by abnormal J-wave manifestation on electrocardiogram (ECG). The J point denotes the junction of the QRS complex and the ST segment on the ECG, marking the end of depolarization and the beginning of repolarization. An abnormal J wave is a deflection with a dome or hump morphology immediately following the QRS complex of the surface ECG. Examples of J-wave disorders are arrhythmias associated with an early repolarization pattern in the inferior or mid to lateral precordial leads, Brugada syndrome, some cases of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) with an early repolarization pattern in the inferior, inferolateral or global leads, as well as arrhythmias associated with hypothermia.; DISEASE: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) [MIM:272120]: SIDS is the sudden death of an infant younger than 1 year that remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of clinical history. Pathophysiologic mechanisms for SIDS may include respiratory dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiorespiratory instability, and inborn errors of metabolism, but definitive pathogenic mechanisms precipitating an infant sudden death remain elusive. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21836131}. Note=Disease susceptibility is associated with variations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Hypertrichotic osteochondrodysplasia (HTOCD) [MIM:239850]: A rare disorder characterized by congenital hypertrichosis, neonatal macrosomia, a distinct osteochondrodysplasia, and cardiomegaly. The hypertrichosis leads to thick scalp hair, which extends onto the forehead, and a general increase in body hair. In addition, macrocephaly and coarse facial features, including a broad nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, a wide mouth, and full lips, can be suggestive of a storage disorder. About half of affected individuals are macrosomic and edematous at birth, whereas in childhood they usually have a muscular appearance with little subcutaneous fat. Thickened calvarium, narrow thorax, wide ribs, flattened or ovoid vertebral bodies, coxa valga, osteopenia, enlarged medullary canals, and metaphyseal widening of long bones have been reported. Cardiac manifestations such as patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, and pericardial effusions are present in approximately 80% of cases. Motor development is usually delayed due to hypotonia. Most patients have a mild speech delay, and a small percentage have learning difficulties or intellectual disability. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24700710}.

Migraine is a disabling symptom complex of periodic headaches, usually temporal and unilateral. Headaches are often accompanied by irritability, nausea, vomiting and photophobia, preceded by constriction of the cranial arteries. The two major subtypes are common migraine (migraine without aura) and classic migraine (migraine with aura). Classic migraine is characterized by recurrent attacks of reversible neurological symptoms (aura) that precede or accompany the headache. Aura may include a combination of sensory disturbances, such as blurred vision, hallucinations, vertigo, numbness and difficulty in concentrating and speaking. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20871611}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry. Susceptibility to migraine has been shown to be conferred by a frameshift mutation that segregates with the disorder in a large multigenerational family. Migraine was associated with sensitivity to lights, sounds, and smells, as well as nausea and occasional vomiting. Triggers included fatigue, alcohol and bright lights. Mutations in KCNK18 are a rare cause of migraine.

Q2M1P5	KIF7	DISEASE: Note=Ciliary dysfunction leads to a broad spectrum of disorders, collectively termed ciliopathies. The ciliopathy range of diseases includes Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and hydrolethalus syndrome among others. Single-locus allelism is insufficient to explain the variable penetrance and expressivity of such disorders, leading to the suggestion that variations across multiple sites of the ciliary proteome influence the clinical outcome. Primary ciliopathy loci can be modulated by pathogenic lesions in other ciliary genes to either exacerbate overall severity or induce specific endophenotypes. KIF7 may be causally associated with diverse ciliopathies, and also acts as a modifier gene across the ciliopathy spectrum.; DISEASE: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) [MIM:209900]: A syndrome characterized by usually severe pigmentary retinopathy, early-onset obesity, polydactyly, hypogenitalism, renal malformation and mental retardation.

Q15726	KISS1	DISEASE: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 13 with or without anosmia (HH13) [MIM:614842]: A disorder characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation by the age of 18 years, in conjunction with low levels of circulating gonadotropins and testosterone and no other abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22335740}.

In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12944565, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14573733, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15598687, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17164310, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23643382, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25077900}.

An almost total lack of LCT activity is found in jejunal biopsy material of patients with congenital lactase deficiency. Opposite to congenital lactase deficiency, also known as lactose intolerance, is the most common enzyme deficiency worldwide. It is caused by developmental down-regulation of lactase activity during childhood or early adulthood. The decline of lactase activity is a normal physiological phenomenon; however, the majority of Northern Europeans have the ability to maintain lactase activity and digest lactose throughout life (lactase persistence). The down-regulation of lactase activity operates at the transcriptional level and it is associated with a noncoding variation in the MCM6 gene, located in the upstream vicinity of LCT. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16400612}.

The main skeletal malformations include fusion of vertebrae, hemivertebrae, fusion of certain ribs, and other rib malformations. Deformity of the chest and spine (severe scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis and lordosis) is a natural consequence of the malformation and leads to a dwarf-like appearance. As the thorax is small, infants frequently have respiratory insufficiency and repeated respiratory infections resulting in life-threatening complications in the first year of life. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16385447}.

Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry. HGPS is caused by the toxic accumulation of a truncated form of lamin-A/C. This mutant protein, called progerin (isoform 6), acts to deregulate mitosis and DNA damage signaling, leading to premature cell death and senescence. The mutant form is mainly generated by a silent or missense mutation at codon 608 of prelamin A that causes activation of a cryptic splice donor site, resulting in production of isoform 6 with a deletion of 50 amino acids near the C terminus. Progerin lacks the conserved ZMPSTE24/FACE1 cleavage site and therefore remains permanently farnesylated. Thus, although it can enter the nucleus and associate with the nuclear envelope, it cannot incorporate normally into the nuclear lamina (PubMed:12714972). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12714972}.; DISEASE: Cardiomyopathy, dilated, with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (CMDHH) [MIM:212112]: A disorder characterized by the association of genital anomalies, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and dilated cardiomyopathy.

Opacities vary in morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be static or progressive. In general, the more posteriorly located and dense an opacity, the greater the impact on visual function. CTRCT21 includes cerulean and pulverulent cataracts. Cerulean cataracts are characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract. Pulverulent cataracts are characterized by a dust-like, 'pulverised' appearance of the opacities which can be found in any part of the lens. In some cases cataract is associated with microcornea without any other systemic anomaly or dysmorphism. Microcornea is defined by a corneal diameter inferior to 10 mm in both meridians in an otherwise normal eye. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11772997, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16470690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24664492}.

O15232	MATN3	DISEASE: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia 5 (EDM5) [MIM:607078]: A generalized skeletal dysplasia associated with significant morbidity. Joint pain, joint deformity, waddling gait, and short stature are the main clinical signs and symptoms. Radiological examination of the skeleton shows delayed, irregular mineralization of the epiphyseal ossification centers and of the centers of the carpal and tarsal bones. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is broadly categorized into the more severe Fairbank and the milder Ribbing types. The Fairbank type is characterized by shortness of stature, short and stubby fingers, small epiphyses in several joints, including the knee, ankle, hand, and hip. The Ribbing type is confined predominantly to the hip joints and is characterized by hands that are normal and stature that is normal or near-normal. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 5 is relatively mild and clinically variable. It is primarily characterized by delayed and irregular ossification of the epiphyses and early-onset osteoarthritis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11479597, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12884427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14729835, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15459972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15948199, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16287128, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21922596}.

An intragenic MCTP2 duplication, leading to premature truncation (F697X) within the first transmembrane region of the protein, has also been observed in a male patient with a non-syndromic complex cardiac malformation involving coarctation, hypoplastic left heart, mitral atresia, bicuspid aortic valve and muscular ventricular septal defect. Although the link between left ventricular outflow tract malformations and MCTP2 could not be established, it has been proposed that defects in the MCTP2 gene may contribute to phenotype. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that Xenopus laevis embryos treated with MCTP2 morpholinos show no evidence of endocardial cushion formation at any level of the developing outflow tract (PubMed:23773997). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23773997}.	1596;

It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21120944, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8797773, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

VEOIBD is subdivided into Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis phenotypes. Crohn disease may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus, but the phenotype of children with onset of Crohn disease occurring younger than the age of 10 is predominantly colonic, with a lower risk of ileal disease. Bowel inflammation is transmural and discontinuous; it may contain granulomas or be associated with intestinal or perianal fistulas. In contrast, in ulcerative colitis, the inflammation is continuous and limited to rectal and colonic mucosal layers; fistulas and granulomas are not observed. Both diseases include extraintestinal inflammation of the skin, eyes, or joints. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26301257}.

Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry. XY individuals with a duplication of part of the short arm of the X chromosome and an intact SRY gene develop as females. The single X chromosome in these individuals does not undergo X-chromosome inactivation; therefore, these individuals presumably carry 2 active copies of genes, including the NR0B1 gene, in the duplicated region. Individuals with deletion of this region develop as males. Genes within the dosage-sensitive sex reversal region are, therefore, not essential for testis development, but, when present in a double dose, interfere with testis formation.	242;251510;95702;

Q99650	OSMR	DISEASE: Amyloidosis, primary localized cutaneous, 1 (PLCA1) [MIM:105250]: A primary amyloidosis characterized by localized cutaneous amyloid deposition. This condition usually presents with itching (especially on the lower legs) and visible changes of skin hyperpigmentation and thickening that may be exacerbated by chronic scratching and rubbing. Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis is often divided into macular and lichen subtypes although many affected individuals often show both variants coexisting. Lichen amyloidosis characteristically presents as a pruritic eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules with a predilection for the shins, calves, ankles and dorsa of feet and thighs. Papules may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic plaques that can resemble lichen planus, lichen simplex or nodular prurigo. Macular amyloidosis is characterized by small pigmented macules that may merge to produce macular hyperpigmentation, sometimes with a reticulate or rippled pattern. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, amyloid is deposited in the papillary dermis in association with grouped colloid bodies, thought to represent degenerate basal keratinocytes. The amyloid deposits probably reflect a combination of degenerate keratin filaments, serum amyloid P component, and deposition of immunoglobulins. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18179886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19690585}.

Osteopetrosis occurs in two forms: a severe autosomal recessive form occurring in utero, infancy, or childhood, and a benign autosomal dominant form occurring in adolescence or adulthood. Recessive osteopetrosis commonly manifests in early infancy with macrocephaly, feeding difficulties, evolving blindness and deafness, bone marrow failure, severe anemia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Deafness and blindness are generally thought to represent effects of pressure on nerves. OPTB5 patients manifest primary central nervous system involvement in addition to the classical stigmata of severe bone sclerosis, growth failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia and visual impairment with optic atrophy. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12627228, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16813530}.

Additional features are characteristic postural abnormalities, dysautonomia, dystonic cramps, and dementia. The pathology of Parkinson disease involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies (intraneuronal accumulations of aggregated proteins), in surviving neurons in various areas of the brain. The disease is progressive and usually manifests after the age of 50 years, although early-onset cases (before 50 years) are known. The majority of the cases are sporadic suggesting a multifactorial etiology based on environmental and genetic factors. However, some patients present with a positive family history for the disease. Familial forms of the disease usually begin at earlier ages and are associated with atypical clinical features. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12629236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12730996}.

P42336	PIK3CA	DISEASE: Note=PIK3CA mutations are involved in various type of cancer. Most of the cancer-associated mutations are missense mutations and map to one of the three hotspots: Glu-542; Glu-545 and His-1047. Mutated isoforms participate in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis induced by oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and HRAS/KRAS. Interaction with HRAS/KRAS is required for Ras-driven tumor formation. Mutations increasing the lipid kinase activity are required for oncogenic signaling. The protein kinase activity may not be required for tumorigenesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15016963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15289301, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15520168, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15712344, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15784156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15924253, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15930273, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15994075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16114017, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16322209, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16353168, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16432179, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16533766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17673550, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19805105, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21708979, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22658544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22729224}.; DISEASE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) [MIM:114500]: A complex disease characterized by malignant lesions arising from the inner wall of the large intestine (the colon) and the rectum.

Q6DJT9	PLAG1	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving PLAG1 is found in salivary gland pleiomorphic adenomas, the most common benign epithelial tumors of the salivary gland. Translocation t(3;8)(p21;q12) with constituvely expressed beta-catenin/CTNNB1. Fusion occurs in the 5'-regulatory regions, leading to promoter swapping between the 2 genes and activation of PLAG1 expression in adenomas. The chimeric transcript is formed by fusion of CTNNB1 exon 1 to PLAG1 exon 3. Reciprocal fusion transcript consisting of PLAG1 exon 1 and CTNNB1 exon 2-16 is also revealed in some adenomas (PubMed:9020842, PubMed:10029085). Translocation t(3;8)(p21;q12) with transcription elongation factor SII/TCEA1. The fusion transcript is composed of 5'-non-coding sequences as well as 63 nucleotides of the coding region of TCEA1 fused to the acceptor splice site of PLAG1 exon 3. The fusion transcript encodes a truncated TCEA1-PLAG1 protein of 90 AA as well as an apparently normal PLAG1 protein. Reciprocal fusion transcript PLAG1-TCEA1 is also present in one adenoma (PubMed:10029085, PubMed:16736500). Translocation t(5;8)(p13;q12) with leukemia inhibitory factor receptor LIFR. This fusion occured in the 5'-non-coding sequences of both genes, exchanging regulatory control element while preserving the coding sequences (PubMed:9525740). Translocation t(6;8)(p21.3-22;q13) with Coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing protein 7/CHCHD7. Fusion occurs in the 5' regulatory regions, leading to promoter swapping and up-regulation of PLAG1 expression (PubMed:16736500). Ectopic expression of PLAG1 under the control of promoters of distinct translocation partner genes is a general pathogenetic mechanism for pleiomorphic adenomas with 8q aberrations. These fusion genes are likely to be found in adenomas with normal karyotype as this subgroup of tumors also exhibit PLAG1 activation (PubMed:9020842, PubMed:10029085, PubMed:9525740, PubMed:16736500). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10029085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16736500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9020842, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9525740}.; DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving PLAG1 may be a cause of lipoblastomas, which are benign tumors resulting from transformation of adipocytes, usually diagnosed in children. 8q12.1 to 8q24.1 intrachromosomal rearrangement with hyaluronic acid synthase 2/HAS2 results in promoter swapping and activation of PLAG1 expression. The breakpoint of HAS2 gene is in PLAG1 intron 1, whereas its coding sequence starts at exon 2 or exon 3. Translocation t(7;8)(p22;q13) with collagen 1A2/COL1A2. Fusion transcript COL1A2-PLAG1 as well as HAS2-PLAG1 encode a full-length PLAG1 protein. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10987300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15642402}.

P54278	PMS2	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Q8N3J5	PPM1K	DISEASE: Maple syrup urine disease, mild variant (MSUDMV) [MIM:615135]: A mild form of maple syrup urine disease, a metabolic disorder due to an enzyme defect in the catabolic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Accumulation of these 3 amino acids and their corresponding keto acids leads to encephalopathy and progressive neurodegeneration. Clinical features include mental and physical retardation, feeding problems, and a maple syrup odor to the urine. The keto acids of the branched-chain amino acids are present in the urine. If untreated, maple syrup urine disease can lead to seizures, coma, and death. The disease is often classified by its pattern of signs and symptoms. The most common and severe form of the disease is the classic type, which becomes apparent soon after birth. Variant forms of the disorder become apparent later in infancy or childhood and are typically milder, but they still involve developmental delay and other medical problems if not treated. MSUDMV is characterized by increased plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) apparent at birth. Treatment with a low-protein diet free of BCAA can result in normal psychomotor development and lack of metabolic episodes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23086801}.

The prion diseases illustrate three manifestations of CNS degeneration: (1) infectious (2) sporadic and (3) dominantly inherited forms. TME, CWD, BSE, FSE, EUE are all thought to occur after consumption of prion-infected foodstuffs. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8105771}.; DISEASE: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) [MIM:123400]: Occurs primarily as a sporadic disorder (1 per million), while 10-15% are familial. Accidental transmission of CJD to humans appears to be iatrogenic (contaminated human growth hormone (HGH), corneal transplantation, electroencephalographic electrode implantation, etc.). Epidemiologic studies have failed to implicate the ingestion of infected animal meat in the pathogenesis of CJD in human. The triad of microscopic features that characterize the prion diseases consists of (1) spongiform degeneration of neurons, (2) severe astrocytic gliosis that often appears to be out of proportion to the degree of nerve cell loss, and (3) amyloid plaque formation. CJD is characterized by progressive dementia and myoclonic seizures, affecting adults in mid-life. Some patients present sleep disorders, abnormalities of high cortical function, cerebellar and corticospinal disturbances.

In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17054399, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18559922, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23643382, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25077900}.

Characterized by motor and sensory neuropathy with very slow nerve conduction velocities, increased cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations, hypertrophic nerve changes, delayed age of walking as well as areflexia. There are both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of Dejerine-Sottas syndrome. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11133365}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 4F (CMT4F) [MIM:614895]: A recessive demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy, initially of the peroneal muscles and later of the distal muscles of the arms. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Demyelinating neuropathies are characterized by severely reduced nerve conduction velocities (less than 38 m/sec), segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy, slowly progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hollow feet. By convention autosomal recessive forms of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are designated CMT4. CMT4F is characterized by distal sensory impairment and distal muscle weakness and atrophy affecting the lower more than the upper limbs. The age at onset is variable and can range from childhood to adult years. When the onset is in infancy, the phenotype is characterized as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22847150}.

Q68CZ1	RPGRIP1L	DISEASE: Note=Ciliary dysfunction leads to a broad spectrum of disorders, collectively termed ciliopathies. Overlapping clinical features include retinal degeneration, renal cystic disease, skeletal abnormalities, fibrosis of various organ, and a complex range of anatomical and functional defects of the central and peripheral nervous system. The ciliopathy range of diseases includes Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Joubert syndrome, nephronophtisis, Senior-Loken syndrome, and Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy among others. Single-locus allelism is insufficient to explain the variable penetrance and expressivity of such disorders, leading to the suggestion that variations across multiple sites of the ciliary proteome, including RPGRIP1L, influence the clinical outcome. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19430481, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21258341}.; DISEASE: Joubert syndrome 7 (JBTS7) [MIM:611560]: A disorder presenting with cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, hypotonia, neonatal breathing abnormalities and psychomotor delay.

In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22416012, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22927827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25077900}.

Q9GZV3	SLC5A7	DISEASE: Neuronopathy, distal hereditary motor, 7A (HMN7A) [MIM:158580]: A neuromuscular disorder. Distal hereditary motor neuronopathies constitute a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders caused by selective degeneration of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, without sensory deficit in the posterior horn. The overall clinical picture consists of a classical distal muscular atrophy syndrome in the legs without clinical sensory loss. The disease starts with weakness and wasting of distal muscles of the anterior tibial and peroneal compartments of the legs. Later on, weakness and atrophy may expand to the proximal muscles of the lower limbs and/or to the distal upper limbs. HMN7A is characterized by onset in the second decade of progressive distal muscle wasting and weakness affecting the upper and lower limbs and resulting in walking difficulties and hand grip.

Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry. Copy number variations (CNV) encompassing or in close proximity to SOX3 are responsible for XX male reversal. These variations include two duplications of approximately 123 kb and 85 kb, the former of which spans the entire SOX3 gene; a 343 kb deletion immediately upstream of SOX3 that is probably responsible of altered regulation (and not increased dosage) of SOX3; a large (approximately 6 Mb) duplication that encompasses SOX3 and at least 18 additional distally located genes. Its proximal breakpoint falls within the SOX3 regulatory region. This large rearrangement has been found in a patient with XX male reversal and a complex phenotype that also includes a scrotal hypoplasia, microcephaly, developmental delay, and growth retardation.	393;90695;3157;79495;67045;

Q9C004	SPRY4	DISEASE: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 17 with or without anosmia (HH17) [MIM:615266]: A disorder characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation by the age of 18 years, in conjunction with low levels of circulating gonadotropins and testosterone and no other abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23643382}.

Q15468	STIL	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving STIL may be a cause of some T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL). A deletion at 1p32 between STIL and TAL1 genes leads to STIL/TAL1 fusion mRNA with STIL exon 1 splicing to TAL1 exon 3. As both STIL exon 1 and TAL1 exon 3 are 5'-untranslated exons, STIL/TAL1 fusion mRNA predicts a full length TAL1 protein under the control of the STIL promoter, leading to inappropriate TAL1 expression. In childhood T-cell malignancies (T-ALL), a type of defect such as STIL/TAL1 fusion is associated with a good prognosis. In cultured lymphocytes from healthy adults, STIL/TAL1 fusion mRNA may be detected after 7 days of culture. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11390401, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12681356, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1311214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14504110, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1922059, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2209547, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2255914}.; DISEASE: Microcephaly 7, primary, autosomal recessive (MCPH7) [MIM:612703]: A disease defined as a head circumference more than 3 standard deviations below the age-related mean.

P37173	TGFBR2	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 6 (HNPCC6) [MIM:614331]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9590282}.

Q5HYA8	TMEM67	DISEASE: Note=TMEM67 mutations result in ciliary dysfunction leading to a broad spectrum of disorders, collectively termed ciliopathies. Overlapping clinical features include retinal degeneration, renal cystic disease, skeletal abnormalities, fibrosis of various organ, and a complex range of anatomical and functional defects of the central and peripheral nervous system. The ciliopathy range of diseases includes Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and nephronophtisis among others. Single-locus allelism is insufficient to explain the variable penetrance and expressivity of such disorders, leading to the suggestion that variations across multiple sites of the ciliary proteome influence the clinical outcome. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18327255, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21633164}.; DISEASE: Meckel syndrome 3 (MKS3) [MIM:607361]: A disorder characterized by a combination of renal cysts and variably associated features including developmental anomalies of the central nervous system (typically encephalocele), hepatic ductal dysplasia and cysts, and polydactyly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16415887, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19466712, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20232449}.

Individuals with IGAD also suffer from recurrent sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections and have an increased incidence of autoimmune disorders and of lymphoid and non-lymphoid malignancies. In vitro studies have suggested that some individuals with IGAD have impaired isotype class switching to IgA and others may have a post-switch defect. IGAD and CVID have been known to coexist in families. Some individuals initially present with IGAD1 and then develop CVID.

Autosomal dominant NEM1 is characterized by a moderate phenotype with onset between birth and early second decade of life. Weakness is diffuse and symmetric with slow progression often with need for a wheelchair in adulthood. The autosomal recessive form has onset at birth with moderate to severe hypotonia and diffuse weakness. In the most severe cases, death can occur before 2 years. Less severe cases have delayed major motor milestones, and these patients may walk, but often need a wheelchair before 10 years. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17376686, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24692096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7704029}.

P16473	TSHR	DISEASE: Note=Defects in TSHR are found in patients affected by hyperthyroidism with different etiologies. Somatic, constitutively activating TSHR mutations and/or constitutively activating G(s)alpha mutations have been identified in toxic thyroid nodules (TTNs) that are the predominant cause of hyperthyroidism in iodine deficient areas. These mutations lead to TSH independent activation of the cAMP cascade resulting in thyroid growth and hormone production. TSHR mutations are found in autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN), toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG) and hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas (HTA). TMNG encompasses a spectrum of different clinical entities, ranging from a single hyperfunctioning nodule within an enlarged thyroid, to multiple hyperfunctioning areas scattered throughout the gland. HTA are discrete encapsulated neoplasms characterized by TSH-independent autonomous growth, hypersecretion of thyroid hormones, and TSH suppression. Defects in TSHR are also a cause of thyroid neoplasms (papillary and follicular cancers).; DISEASE: Note=Autoantibodies against TSHR are directly responsible for the pathogenesis and hyperthyroidism of Graves disease.

Osteoclastic overactivity followed by compensatory osteoblastic activity leads to a structurally disorganized mosaic of bone (woven bone), which is mechanically weaker, larger, less compact, more vascular, and more susceptible to fracture than normal adult lamellar bone. PDB6 is characterized by adult onset of bone pain associated with polyostotic bone lesions primarily affecting the axial skeleton. In some cases, the pagetic tissue undergoes neoplastic transformation, resulting in osteosarcoma and, less frequently, in giant cell tumor of bone. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26849110}.

Q8N859	ZNF713	DISEASE: Note=A 7p11.2 folate-sensitive fragile site, FRA7A, has been identified in 2 unrelated families diagnosed with an autistic disorder. FRA7A is associated with a CGG-repeat expansion in a ZNF713 5'-intron. In the first family, the expanded allele contained about 450 CGG-repeats. It showed hypermethylation and reduced ZNF713 expression. In the second family, 3 autistic siblings exhibited a heterozygous expansion of about 70 repeats, corresponding to premutations, which were partially or mosaically methylated. Mitotic instability of the premutation was observed in one affected sibling. In this family, ZNF713 tends to be up-regulated. It has been suggested that ZNF713 misregulation in the brain might be involved in the pathogenicity of autistic disorder (PubMed:25196122). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25196122}.
